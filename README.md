I have done this project of calculating the Fair Value of Marico Bangladesh Limited via Discounted Cash Flow Valuation. In some parts of this analysis I have figured that there are some problem in calculating the Unlevered Free Cash Flows. However, I have tried to calculate the UFCF as accurate as possible. After taking all the data from the sources of the financials statements, I have made all the best possible assumptions and made the valuation a bit meaningful.
